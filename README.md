# Consistant frame caping
Use RTSS for framerate caping over build-in game engines caps. RTSS is the best in frametime consistancy.
Apex Legends and other Soruce Engine games cannot register inputs between frames. The more frames the more often Apex can register inputs.
If your framerate is flactuating your "mouse feeling" will feel off and inconsistent.
