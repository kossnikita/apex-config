2. Paste this inside the Run box: "%USERPROFILE%\Saved Games\Respawn\Apex\local" (without the Quotation marks)
3. Open up the Videoconfig.txt with Wordpad or Notepad++.
4. Replace everything in it with the code from [videoconfig](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kossnikita/apex-config/master/videoconfig.txt)
5. Save and make the file read-only.


## Consistant frame caping
Use RTSS for framerate caping over build-in game engines caps. RTSS is the best in frametime consistancy.
Apex Legends and other Soruce Engine games cannot register inputs between frames. The more frames the more often Apex can register inputs.
If your framerate is flactuating your "mouse feeling" will feel off and inconsistent.
